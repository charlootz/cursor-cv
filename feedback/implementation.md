   - Copy all recommendations into this template

2. **Work Systematically**
   - Start with Critical items
   - Check off items as you complete them
   - Document exactly what you changed

3. **Track Your Progress**
   - Update status fields as you work
   - Note specific changes made
   - Keep the original text for comparison

4. **Quality Control**
   - Use the quality check section to ensure completeness
   - Verify all keywords were added
