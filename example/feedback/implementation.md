## Results Tracking

### Version Performance
- **v1-baseline**: Never used for applications
- **v2-openai-search**: 
  - Alignment Score: 7/10 (up from estimated 5/10)
  - Keywords Added: 15+
  - Search Focus: Every role now has search context

### Key Improvements Made
1. **Search Narrative**: Every experience now tells a search story
2. **Technical Depth**: Added specific technical implementations
3. **Scale Indicators**: 50K MAU â†’ 10M+ requests, 100K+ users
4. **Safety Focus**: New bullet on AI safety guidelines
5. **Consumer Experience**: Highlighted in 2 roles + side project

### Lessons Learned
- Reframing existing experience is powerful (didn't need new experience)
- Specific technical details (ranking algorithms, semantic search) add credibility
- Quantifying impact at scale addresses the scale gap
- Side projects can fill domain gaps effectively

### Next Application Strategy
1. Submit optimized v2 resume
2. Reference blog post in cover letter
3. Mention Stanford CS276 enrollment
4. Prepare search-specific case studies for interview
