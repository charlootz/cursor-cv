## Alignment Score: 7/10

### Scoring Rationale:
Strong technical foundation and AI product experience align well with OpenAI's needs. The 0-1 product success and cross-functional leadership are exactly what they're seeking. Main deductions for experience gap (-2) and lack of search-specific background (-1).

## Strengths Analysis

### 1. Technical Background + Product Execution
- CS degree from UC Berkeley with ML coursework
- Built RecipeAI using GPT-3, showing hands-on LLM experience
- Can bridge engineering and product, crucial for search quality work
- Python/SQL skills enable data-driven decisions and technical discussions

### 2. 0-1 AI Product Success
- Launched TechFlow's AI assistant from concept to 50K MAU
- Exceeded adoption targets by 3x (not mentioned in resume - add this!)
- Demonstrates ability to navigate ambiguity and drive innovation
- Aligns perfectly with "enjoy building 0-1 products from the ground up"

### 3. Cross-functional Leadership
- Managed 8 engineers and 2 designers at current role
- Coordinated with sales, customer success, and offshore teams
- Proven stakeholder management across technical and business teams
- Critical for OpenAI's collaborative environment with policy/legal teams

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Must Address)
1. **Years of Experience**
   - What's missing: Job requires 8-10 years, you have 6 years
   - Current state: Resume shows standard progression without accelerated growth indicators
   - Recommendation: Emphasize "Senior" title achieved in 4 years, add leadership scope metrics, highlight advisory/mentorship roles

2. **Search/Information Retrieval Experience**
   - What's missing: No mention of search, ranking, relevance, or information retrieval
   - Current state: AI experience is generic, not search-focused
   - Recommendation: Reframe AI assistant as "intelligent search and response system," add RecipeAI's recipe search/ranking algorithm details

### Moderate Gaps (Should Address)
1. **Consumer Product Experience**
   - What's missing: Role is consumer-facing, your experience is B2B
   - Current state: All roles show enterprise/B2B focus
   - Recommendation: Highlight RecipeAI's 500+ consumer users, add any B2C metrics from mobile app work at CloudBase

2. **Scale of Impact**
   - What's missing: OpenAI operates at massive scale (millions of users)
   - Current state: Largest scale mentioned is 50K MAU
   - Recommendation: Add platform/infrastructure impact metrics (API calls, data processed), emphasize scalability considerations in architecture decisions

### Minor Gaps (Nice to Address)
1. **Model Quality/Evaluation Experience**
   - What's missing: Job mentions "model quality direction"
   - Current state: No mention of model evaluation or quality metrics
   - Recommendation: Add bullet about establishing quality metrics for AI assistant, A/B testing model versions

## Keyword Optimization

### Missing Keywords (Add to Resume):
- **"search"**: Add to AI assistant description: "Built intelligent search and response system"
- **"information retrieval"**: Add to RecipeAI: "Implemented semantic search and information retrieval"

- **"safety"**: Add new bullet: "Established safety guidelines and content filtering for AI responses"
- **"ranking"**: Add to RecipeAI: "Designed ranking algorithm for recipe relevance"

### Underutilized Keywords (Increase Frequency):
- **"AI"**: Current: 3 times, Recommend: 5-6 times
- **"scale"**: Current: 0 times, Recommend: 2-3 times
- **"0-1"**: Current: 0 times, Recommend: 1-2 times
