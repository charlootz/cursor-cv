# Product Manager, Search | OpenAI

## About the Team

The Search team at OpenAI has the mission to give AGI access to factual and up-to-date information, so it can give you the best answers, direct you to trusted sources, and do work on your behalf. We currently build ChatGPT search for consumers, the web search API for developers, and do pioneering research on how to create new models that work well with information from the web. Recently we launched O3 and o4-mini with search, our latest frontier reasoning models.

Across all product lines, we ensure that these powerful tools are used responsibly. This is a key part of OpenAI's path towards safely deploying broadly beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Safety is more important to us than unfettered growth.

## About the Role

We're looking for an experienced product manager to drive the strategy and execution of the ChatGPT Search experience. In this role, you'll own the end-to-end search vision, shape the user and vertical experiences, define the feature roadmap, help guide research and model quality direction, and collaborate closely with policy and legal teams.

This position is based in San Francisco, CA. We utilize a hybrid work model with 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

### You might thrive in this role if you:
- Have 8-10+ years of product management or related industry experience.
- Obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Information Systems, Analytics, Mathematics, Physics, Applied Sciences, or a related field.
- Enjoy building 0-1 products from the ground up.
- Showcase strong leadership, organizational, and execution skills, along with proven communication abilities.
- Enjoy working on both UX and model quality in an integrated fashion.
- Have proven experience working in a technical environment with cross-functional teams to drive product vision, define requirements, and guide the team.
